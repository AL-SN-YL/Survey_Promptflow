Even for A6, basic instructions on how to run the program were missing. Only when someone asked on Ed did Mano tell us. He wrote 4 steps in the instructions to run the program, why not just include that in the assignment page?","The AP Computer Science A course was informative. I learned a lot about Java and basic programming concepts. The teacher provided clear instructions and was available for help when needed. However, some of the material felt repetitive, and the pace of the course was uneven at times. It was a decent introduction to computer science, but I’m not sure if it’s something I want to pursue further","I struggled with the AP Computer Science A course. The concepts were difficult to understand, and the workload was overwhelming. The teacher tried to help, but I often felt lost during lectures. Programming in Java was confusing, and I didn’t enjoy the projects. I’m glad I took the course to see what computer science is like, but it’s definitely not for me.","AP Computer Science A was amazing! The projects were creative and engaging, especially the ones where we could design our own programs. The teacher was enthusiastic and made learning fun. I appreciated the extra resources provided, like online tutorials and practice problems. This course has solidified my decision to major in computer science in college.","The AP Computer Science A course was okay. I learned the basics of Java, which was useful. The teacher explained things well, but sometimes the class felt monotonous. The programming assignments were helpful for practice, but I didn’t find them particularly exciting. Overall, it was a decent class but not my favorite.","I didn’t enjoy the AP Computer Science A course at all. The material was too difficult, and I found the teaching style ineffective. The assignments were frustrating, and I often felt like giving up. Even with extra help, I couldn’t keep up with the class. This experience has made me realize that computer science isn’t the right path for me.","Taking AP Computer Science A was a great decision. The course material was fascinating, and I enjoyed learning how to program in Java. The exercises and projects were practical and helped me understand real-world applications of computer science. The only downside was the occasional frustration with debugging code, but it taught me persistence and problem-solving skills. Our teacher was supportive and made sure everyone understood the concepts. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in technology and programming","AP Computer Science A was a decent course. I learned the basics of Java and some fundamental programming concepts. The teacher was knowledgeable, but the lectures could be dry at times. I liked the hands-on projects, but some of them were too challenging. Overall, it was a good introduction to computer science, but it didn’t ignite a passion for the subject in me.","I found AP Computer Science A very difficult. The programming concepts were hard to grasp, and I didn’t enjoy working with Java. The teacher tried to help, but I still struggled with the assignments. I often felt stressed and frustrated throughout the course. It was not the experience I hoped for, and I’m relieved it’s over","AP Computer Science A was an incredible experience. The course was well-structured, and the projects were both challenging and rewarding. I loved learning Java and applying it to solve real problems. Our teacher was excellent and always provided helpful feedback. This course has definitely inspired me to pursue a career in computer science, and I can’t wait to learn more","I struggled with the AP Computer Science A course.

Maybe offering a short prep course or some additional support sessions at the beginning would help. The grading policy was fair, but the time commitment was quite high, especially when balancing other AP courses.","The course content was interesting, but sometimes it felt a bit disorganized. It would be helpful to have a more structured curriculum with clear modules and milestones. Including more case studies and real-world applications would make the material more engaging and relevant","The videos were helpful, but sometimes they were a bit too long. Shorter, more focused videos with animations to explain complex concepts would be more engaging. More interactive elements, like coding exercises integrated into the lessons, would also help","The teacher was knowledgeable, but sometimes the explanations were too fast and hard to follow. Providing more examples and breaking down complex topics into simpler parts would make it easier to understand. Also, more enthusiasm from the instructor could make the lessons more engaging.","The quizzes and exams were fair, but sometimes they covered material we hadn’t fully gone over in class. More practice quizzes and review sessions before exams would be beneficial. Also, having a variety of question types, not just multiple-choice, would better assess our understanding.","Having more study guides and organized notes would be helpful. Sometimes it was hard to keep track of all the material covered. Also, offering downloadable video transcripts and more recommended readings would enhance our learning resources","I would love to see more opportunities for peer interaction, like discussion forums or study groups. It’s helpful to collaborate and learn from each other. Also, having more regular live office hours with the teacher for real-time questions would be great","It would be great if the school offered more AP courses related to technology and computer science. Also, having a coding club or other extracurricular activities focused on programming could provide additional learning opportunities outside the classroom.","I really liked learning about Java, but I think the course could benefit from including some additional topics like basic web development or data science. These are really popular areas in computer science and could make the course more comprehensive.","Interactive lessons would be a great addition. Step-by-step tutorials where we can code along with the instructor in real-time would be really beneficial. Also, having some deep dive sessions on challenging topics could help clarify difficult concepts"]}},"deployment_name":"gpt-4o"}
