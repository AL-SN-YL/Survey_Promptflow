                    "It would be helpful to have more review sessions before exams and perhaps some additional tutorials on advanced topics to reinforce our understanding",
                    "The course delivery was generally good, but the pace felt a bit too fast for those of us without a strong background in programming. Maybe offering a short prep course or some additional support sessions at the beginning would help. The grading policy was fair, but the time commitment was quite high, especially when balancing other AP courses.",
                    "The course content was interesting, but sometimes it felt a bit disorganized. It would be helpful to have a more structured curriculum with clear modules and milestones. Including more case studies and real-world applications would make the material more engaging and relevant",
                    "The videos were helpful, but sometimes they were a bit too long. Shorter, more focused videos with animations to explain complex concepts would be more engaging. More interactive elements, like coding exercises integrated into the lessons, would also help",
                    "The teacher was knowledgeable, but sometimes the explanations were too fast and hard to follow. Providing more examples and breaking down complex topics into simpler parts would make it easier to understand. Also, more enthusiasm from the instructor could make the lessons more engaging.",
                    "The quizzes and exams were fair, but sometimes they covered material we hadn’t fully gone over in class. More practice quizzes and review sessions before exams would be beneficial. Also, having a variety of question types, not just multiple-choice, would better assess our understanding.",
                    "Having more study guides and organized notes would be helpful. Sometimes it was hard to keep track of all the material covered. Also, offering downloadable video transcripts and more recommended readings would enhance our learning resources",
                    "I would love to see more opportunities for peer interaction, like discussion forums or study groups. It’s helpful to collaborate and learn from each other. Also, having more regular live office hours with the teacher for real-time questions would be great",
                    "It would be great if the school offered more AP courses related to technology and computer science. Also, having a coding club or other extracurricular activities focused on programming could provide additional learning opportunities outside the classroom.",
                    "I really liked learning about Java, but I think the course could benefit from including some additional topics like basic web development or data science. These are really popular areas in computer science and could make the course more comprehensive.",
                    "Interactive lessons would be a great addition. Step-by-step tutorials where we can code along with the instructor in real-time would be really beneficial. Also, having some deep dive sessions on challenging topics could help clarify difficult concepts",
                    "I appreciated the teacher's efforts, but more real-time feedback during coding assignments would be helpful. Sometimes I got stuck and didn’t know how to proceed. Having more opportunities for one-on-one help or small group sessions could improve the learning experience",

              "The course content was interesting, but sometimes it felt a bit disorganized. It would be helpful to have a more structured curriculum with clear modules and milestones. Including more case studies and real-world applications would make the material more engaging and relevant",
              "The videos were helpful, but sometimes they were a bit too long. Shorter, more focused videos with animations to explain complex concepts would be more engaging. More interactive elements, like coding exercises integrated into the lessons, would also help",
              "The teacher was knowledgeable, but sometimes the explanations were too fast and hard to follow. Providing more examples and breaking down complex topics into simpler parts would make it easier to understand. Also, more enthusiasm from the instructor could make the lessons more engaging.",
              "The quizzes and exams were fair, but sometimes they covered material we hadn’t fully gone over in class. More practice quizzes and review sessions before exams would be beneficial. Also, having a variety of question types, not just multiple-choice, would better assess our understanding.",
              "Having more study guides and organized notes would be helpful. Sometimes it was hard to keep track of all the material covered. Also, offering downloadable video transcripts and more recommended readings would enhance our learning resources",

I learned a lot about Java and basic programming concepts. The teacher provided clear instructions and was available for help when needed. However, some of the material felt repetitive, and the pace of the course was uneven at times. It was a decent introduction to computer science, but I’m not sure if it’s something I want to pursue further', 'AP Computer Science A was amazing! The projects were creative and engaging, especially the ones where we could design our own programs. The teacher was enthusiastic and made learning fun. I appreciated the extra resources provided, like online tutorials and practice problems. This course has solidified my decision to major in computer science in college', 'It is a great course', 'Mr. Smith is great', \"My feedback on Computer Science A course is that it's a very valuable course. Mrs. Smith is a good teacher.\", 'I think the computer science A course is a good foundational course for students who are interested in STEM.', 'The computer science A course is not providing me good starting points, even though I am good at math. The coding lessons are not logical. Ms. Smith needs to explain the concepts better. '], 'Suggestions': ['It would be helpful to have more review sessions before exams and perhaps some additional tutorials on advanced topics to reinforce our understanding', 'The course delivery was generally good, but the pace felt a bit too fast for those of us without a strong background in programming. Maybe offering a short prep course or some additional support sessions at the beginning would help. The grading policy was fair, but the time commitment was quite high, especially when balancing other AP courses.', 'The course content was interesting, but sometimes it felt a bit disorganized. It would be helpful to have a more structured curriculum with clear modules and milestones. Including more case studies and real-world applications would make the material more engaging and relevant', 'The videos were helpful, but sometimes they were a bit too long. Shorter, more focused videos with animations to explain complex concepts would be more engaging. More interactive elements, like coding exercises integrated into the lessons, would also help', 'The teacher was knowledgeable, but sometimes the explanations were too fast and hard to follow. Providing more examples and breaking down complex topics into simpler parts would make it easier to understand. Also, more enthusiasm from the instructor could make the lessons more engaging.', 'The quizzes and exams were fair, but sometimes they covered material we hadn’t fully gone over in class. More practice quizzes and review sessions before exams would be beneficial. Also, having a variety of question types, not just multiple-choice, would better assess our understanding.', 'Having more study guides and organized notes would be helpful. Sometimes it was hard to keep track of all the material covered. Also, offering downloadable video transcripts and more recommended readings would enhance our learning resources', 'I would love to see more opportunities for peer interaction, like discussion forums or study groups. It’s helpful to collaborate and learn from each other. Also, having more regular live office hours with the teacher for real-time questions would be great', 'It would be great if the school offered more AP courses related to technology and computer science. Also, having a coding club or other extracurricular activities focused on programming could provide additional learning opportunities outside the classroom.', 'I really liked learning about Java, but I think the course could benefit from including some additional topics like basic web development or data science. These are really popular areas in computer science and could make the course more comprehensive.', 'Interactive lessons would be a great addition. Step-by-step tutorials where we can code along with the instructor in real-time would be really beneficial. Also, having some deep dive sessions on challenging topics could help clarify difficult concepts', \"I appreciated the teacher's efforts, but more real-time feedback during coding assignments would be helpful. Sometimes I got stuck and didn’t know how to proceed. Having more opportunities for one-on-one help or small group sessions could improve the learning experience\", 'I really liked learning about Java, but I think the course could benefit from including some additional topics like basic web development or data science. These are really popular areas in computer science and could make the course more comprehensive', 'More teacher office hours', 'Lunch could be better', 'Lunch could have more options.
